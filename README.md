# FaceRecognition-Python
Face Recognition using dlib and opencv in python

# Dependences
dlib -> pip install dlib <br />
opencv -> pip install opencv-python <br />
numpy -> pip install numpy <br />

# Training
To train your own dataset:
- Add the images on the train folder with only one face each, renaming each in this format: label_to_recognize.number_sequence. Ex: Henrique.1, Henrique.2, Jorge.3, ...
- Run the train.py.

# Test
To test the classifier:
- Run the test.py.

In my exemple, the classifier recognize Donald Trump and his wife. This project is not a political support or criticize, it's only computing :)
