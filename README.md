# FaceRecognition-Python
Face Recognition using dlib and opencv in python

# Dependences
dlib -> pip install dlib
opencv -> pip install opencv-python

# Training
To train your own dataset, add the images with only one face each, renaming each in this format: label.sequence_number. Ex: Henrique.1, Henrique.2, ... Move then to the train folder.

# Test
To test the classifier, run the test.py

In my exemple, the classifier recognize Donald Trump and his Wife. This project is not a political support or criticize, it's only computing :)
